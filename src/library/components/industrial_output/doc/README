Serial output component
=======================

This component is designed to drive output deserializer based on sn74hc594
8-bits shift register with output register. 

FPGA component
--------------

Output component is composed of two 16 bits registers:

|   offset   | name        | description           |
|:-----------|:-----------:|:---------------------:|
|    0x00    | CTRL_DATA   | data and status       |
|    0x01    | ID          | component identifiant |

* CTRL_DATA : Write on first byte to write value on output. The 8th bit is the
  busy bit.
* ID : unique number to identify component.

ARMadeus linux driver
---------------------

The driver is really simple, two modules must be mounted:

> modprobe goutput
> modprobe board_output

Mounting the second module indicate the major and minor number used for each
devices:

> output0: MAJOR: 250 MINOR: 0

With these number it's easy to create the caractere file node :

> mknod /dev/output0 c 250 0

Then to change output value, simply write one byte value on file.
