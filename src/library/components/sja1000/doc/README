SJA1000 CAN Controller interface component
=======================

This component is designed to drive a SJA1000 CAN controller.

FPGA component
--------------

Output component is used for read/write in the SJA1000 registers.
Please see the technical datasheet of the SJA1000 for registers details.

Warning: Please ensure that your configuration respect the timing conditions of the SJA1000.
You must be sure that duration of a low state on the chipselect of the Wrapper will never be
less than 100ns (a little bit more is advised) and after a request of the SJA1000, you must be sure that
the following request will be in 15ns minimum.

Exemple:

in Uboot on ARMadeus Boards

Configuration of the chip select duration (writing 0x00002000 in the register
D8002050):
mw D8002050 00002000

Configuration of the next request time (writing 0x00000d21 in the register D8002054):
mw D8002054 00000d21

ARMadeus linux driver
---------------------

You must load these modules :

> modprobe can
> modprobe can_bcm
> modprobe can_dev
> modprobe can_raw
> modprobe sja1000_apf
> modprobe sja1000_platform

Use this command to set the bitrate :

> ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 125000

Verify that your interface is correctly mounted :

> ifconfig can0
