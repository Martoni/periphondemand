.. This is the roadmap of POD

* **POD 1.0 :**

  * VHDL Intercon generation
  * VHDL top generation
  * ARMadeus 4.0 templates available for multiple instances of a component 
  
* **POD 1.1 :**
  
  * Platform and library out of POD repository
  * Manage FPGA IOs settings with FPGA configuration files for each type of FPGA
  * All armadeus wiki documentation transfered
  * Functionals tests
  * Unit tests
  * Improve code quality according to Pylint and PEP8
  
* **POD 1.2 :**

  * Python 3
  * Improve wishbone management
  
    * Fusion of all wishbone bus (wb8, wb16, wb32)
    * Generate intercon that adapte slav size according to master
    * Manage wait states compatibility master-slave
  
  * Adding Quartus in generatebitstream
  * Adding APF6_SP platform
  * Busses documentation
  * Improve code quality according to Pylint and PEP8
  * More unit tests
  
* **POD 1.3 :**
  
  * Code quality good according to pylint and PEP8 (no warning)
  * 100% code test coverage
  
* **POD 2.0 :**
  
  * Adding Verilog HDL language with VHDL component-top generation
  * Adding Others HDL language like Migen and Chisel
  * GUI
